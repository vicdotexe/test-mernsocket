maybe something like this?


----------------------- The waiting area component to initialize the game  ------------------
initializingView state:{
    isReady:bool, //triggered on button click (if color is picked) -> emits to server that we are ready and sends color data
    waiting:bool //waiting for another player to make a turn (probably can be used for both waiting for player to be ready and to take turn)
    color/faction:string, //the color they picked
}

------------------------ Gamestate Data sent from server after each turn --------------------
/** this is the data that the server will emit to the client after a card has been placed, retrieved with socket
    with this we can 
    - show the color-picker and ready button or the waiting visual, 
    - determine if we render 'waiting' or enable dragging cards from your hand 
    - process any of the 'changes' accordingly to trigger animations
*/
gamestate:{
    initializing:bool, //true until server says both players clicked ready
    active: bool, //true if game is initialized and turns are remaining

    //if both initializing and active are false, then the game is over.

    currentPlayersTurn : id?string?index?,
    grid: array of {card}, // this is just a snapshot of everything after a card has been placed, post any battles (useful for reloads?)
    changes: array of {changeData} // we will have to figure out what all we need to include in the 'changeData'
}

changeData:{
    type: string // cardPlaced or cardFlipped (can't think of any others)
    data: actionData // we will have to define the action data
}

actionData:{ //for card placed
    index: number, //the location it was placed on the grid
    card: cardData // we will have to define the cardData
}

actionData:{ //for card flipped
    index: number, //the location of the defender
    attackerIndex: number, //the location of the attacker
    direction: string, //the direction it was attacked from... 
    // with all 3 of these we can trigger the appropriate animations on both cards

    color/faction: string //the new color/faction (send the data here so we don't have to traverse through the components to find it on the client side)
}


----------------------- Card Component ------------------------------------

cardView state:{
    inFight: bool, //true if it's one of the two cards going head to head... triggered by a socket event
    offensive: bool, //true if card is offensive in the fight, false if defensive
    opponentDirection:string // undefined unless inFight is true

    //a combination of (inFight/offensive/opponentDirection) will determine an animation
    //once the animation finishes, kick off the next one

    color/faction: string, //which ever color the card is currently flipped to
}

cardView props:{
    name:string,
    compass:array of {number}, // [top,right,bottom,left]
    owner:id?string?index?,
    ranged: bool,
    initialColor/Faction: string
}
